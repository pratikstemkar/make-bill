## 🎯 What is make-bill?

Have you ever spent hours trying to generate pixel-perfect invoices programmatically? Fought with HTML-to-PDF libraries that never quite render things correctly? **make-bill** was built to solve exactly that.

It's a modern web application that combines:
- A **visual drag-and-drop editor** for designing invoice templates
- **Pixel-perfect PDF generation** via a simple REST API
- **Dynamic data binding** so your templates come alive with real data

Think of it as Canva meets Stripe Invoices—design once, generate forever.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18 or higher
- **Bun** (recommended) or npm/yarn/pnpm
- A **Supabase** project (for authentication and template storage)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pratikstemkar/make-bill.git
   cd make-bill
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   bun install
   # or
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   Copy the example environment file and fill in your credentials:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

   Your `.env.local` should contain:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

4. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   bun dev
   # or
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**

   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start building!

## 🎨 Using the Visual Editor

The heart of make-bill is its visual editor. Here's how to create your first template:

### 1. Open the Editor

Click **"Open Editor"** from the landing page or navigate directly to `/editor`.

### 2. Add Elements

The left panel contains your toolbox. Drag elements onto the canvas:

- **Text** — Static text or dynamic data bindings
- **Image** — Upload logos, product images, or signatures
- **Line** — Horizontal separators for visual structure
- **Table** — Dynamic tables that expand with your data

### 3. Configure Page Settings

At the top of the left panel, configure your document:

- **Page Size** — A4, A3, A5, Letter, or Legal
- **Orientation** — Portrait or Landscape
- **Margins** — Control the printable area

### 4. Bind Data to Elements

Select a text element and use the Inspector panel (right side) to set a **binding path**:

```
invoice.customer.name
invoice.number
invoice.date
invoice.total
```

When you generate the PDF via API, these placeholders are replaced with actual data.

### 5. Preview Your Template

Click **"Preview"** to see how your invoice will look with sample data.

### 6. Save Your Template

Hit **"Save Template"** to persist your design. Templates are versioned, so you can iterate without breaking existing integrations.

---

## 📡 API Usage

Once you've designed and saved a template, generate PDFs with a simple HTTP request.

### Generate a PDF

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/generate-pdf \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "templateId": "invoice_v1",
    "data": {
      "invoice": {
        "number": "INV-2024-001",
        "date": "2024-01-15",
        "customer": {
          "name": "Acme Corporation",
          "address": "123 Business Street"
        },
        "items": [
          { "name": "Consulting Services", "qty": 10, "price": 150 },
          { "name": "Development Work", "qty": 20, "price": 100 }
        ],
        "total": 3500
      }
    }
  }'
```

### Response

The API returns the PDF as a binary stream with `Content-Type: application/pdf`.

  fontSize: 16,
  fontWeight: "bold" | "normal",

## 🚢 Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

make-bill is optimized for Vercel deployment. Simply connect your GitHub repository and Vercel will handle the rest.

> **Note:** PDF generation uses `@sparticuz/chromium` which is specifically optimized for serverless environments like Vercel Functions.

### Other Platforms

For other platforms, ensure you have:
- Node.js 18+ runtime
- Sufficient memory for Puppeteer (512MB+ recommended)
- Proper environment variable configuration
